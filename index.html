            <h2> WHAT REMAINS</h2>
            <p>
The woman stooped low and gathered a motionless bundle of fur into her arms. She cradled it before laying the 
              dead raccoon into a sack that hung from her shoulder. She finished her round of the neighborhood, finding
              a flattened squirrel whose tail had fallen off. There was also what she guessed was a crow. She brushed the
              feathers and her thumb dipped into its skull. Maybe it was a young raven. Careful to hold the sack in such 
              a way that it didn’t bounce against her hip, she walked home. The rusted gate squeaked shut behind her.
Her spade scraped away chunks of dirt, throwing it onto her lap and into her shoes. The sun was nearly set when 
              she finished the first carefully-squared hole. She laid the raccoon in and pushed handfuls of dirt over him, 
              pressing it into a mound before she topped it with a small rock. Sitting on her heels, she wiped her forehead 
              with the back of her hand. The squirrel and what re- mained of the crow had their own graves and stones when 
              she brushed her hands on her pants and cracked her back....</p>

            <h2>THE PERFECT EXCUSE</h2>
            <p>
Bright, bloody liquid trickled from her hand down her forearm in a steady stream.
              It was cooler than she had expected. And thinner. Not that she’d 
              really given it much thought. This was more impulsive; a spur of the 
              moment action. Somewhere in the depths of her despair, she had come
              across the wild conclusion that it might satisfy her rage, soothe her. It hadn’t.
              Of course, that was to be expected.
The knife she’d been using mere moments earlier was laying on the terracotta tiles, 
              just over to her left. She only noticed it there now because somewhere off in the
              distance, a cloud had shifted, drifted, blown away by the autumn breeze, unveiling 
              a ray of sun that perfectly-almost so perfectly you’d think it was planned-illuminated
              the sharp crimson-streaked blade through the window above the sink. A few red splotches 
              attempted to blend in with the clay-coloured floor. She couldn’t take her eyes off of him.
He was perfectly still, staring back at her with a look of what? Confusion? Annoyance? Loathing?
